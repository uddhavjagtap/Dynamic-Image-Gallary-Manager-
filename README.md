i have recently completed a dynamic website project where users can register, log in securely with encrypted passwords (using MD5), 
and manage their account activities. Upon logging in, users are directed to a homepage featuring a personalized "My Account" section.
Within this section, users can:
Upload images that dynamically appear on their account page.
Update and delete uploaded images directly from their account interface.
Experience real-time updates as uploaded images are reflected in a homepage slider.
Technologies utilized include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend interactivity, and PHP with MySQL for backend database management.
This project showcases my proficiency in full-stack web development, emphasizing user authentication, CRUD operations, and dynamic content integration
